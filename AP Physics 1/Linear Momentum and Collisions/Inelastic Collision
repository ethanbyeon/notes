Inelastic Collision: Collision which momentum is conserved but not kinetic energy.
Perfectly Inelastic Collision: Collision where objects stick together and have the same final velocity.
Explosion: Reverse inelastic collision where momentum is conserved and kinetic energy increases.

How to determine if a collision is elastic or inelastic
If objects stick together, then a collision is perfectly inelastic. 
When objects donâ€™t stick together, we can figure out the type of collision by finding the initial kinetic energy and comparing it with the final kinetic energy. 
If the kinetic energy is the same, then the collision is elastic. 
If the kinetic energy changes, then the collision is inelastic regardless of whether the objects stick together or not. 
In either case, for collisions with no external forces, momentum is conserved.

Common mistakes and misconceptions
People sometimes think that objects must stick together in an inelastic collision. 
However, objects only stick together during a perfectly inelastic collision. 
Objects may also bounce off each other or explode apart, and the collision is still considered inelastic as long as kinetic energy is not conserved.

Sometimes people think kinetic energy is only lost during inelastic collisions. 
Collisions are considered inelastic when kinetic energy is not conserved, but this could be from either a loss or gain or kinetic energy. 
For example, in an explosion-type collision, the kinetic energy increases.

It is common for people to try to conserve energy in a collision. 
We can only do this if we are told the collision is perfectly elastic.
