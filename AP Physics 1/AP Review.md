Velocity = Distance / Time
Distance = final - initial
Average Velocity = abs(final - initial) / t
Average Speed = abs(final - initial) / t

Instantneous Velocity = the slope at the exact position

Finding Displacement From Velocity Graphs
Find the area under the velocity vs. time graph

Acceleration and Velocity Graphs
Slope = linear + negative -> a = constant + negative

Kinematic Equations
v = vi + at
v^2 = vi^2 + 2a(delta x)
delta x = (v + vi / 2) t
delta x = vit + 1/2 at^2

Projectile Motion
Vertical velocity is zero at the maximum height

Nothing accelerates a projectile horizontally, so it is always zero
Horizontal velocity is constant throughout the entire trajectory

Higher launch angles have higher maximum height and greater hang time
Projectile maximum horizontal distance depends on horizontal velocity and time in air (45 degrees for optimization)

Newton's First Law: Fg = W = mg
An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon an external force.

Newton's Second Law: F = ma

Newton's Third Law: Action-reaction pair
Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body exerts a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body

delta theta = delta distance / radius
Average angular velocity: w = delta theta / delta t
Linear speed: v = r * w
Period: T = 2pi / w = 1 / f

Angular speed does not chagne with radius

Centripetal Acceleration
radial acceleration: ac = v^2 / r , ac = w^2 * r

Fg = Gm1m2 / r^2
G = 6.67 * 10^-11

Gravitational field strength: g = Gm / r^2

Work: w = Fd * cos0
No work done if the force is perpendicular to displacement

Kinetic Energy: K = 1/2 mv^2
Net work on an object is equal to the object's final kinetic energy minus the initial kinetic energy.
Work-energy theorem: Net work done on an object equals the object's change in KE.

Conservative force: force for which the work done by the force only depends on the initial and final positions and is independent of path taken. The net work is zero when the starting and ending positions are the same (Gravity)

Potential Energy: mg * delta y

Fs = k abs(x)
Elastic potential energy: Us = 1/2 kx^2

Hooke's Law: Force required to stretch an elastic object such as a metal spring is directly proportional to the extension of the spring for small distances. The force exerted back by the spring is known as Hooke's Law.

Spring Force: Fs = -kx.

Conservative force: A force for which the work done by the force only depends on the initial and final positions and is independent of path taken
Nonconservative force: A force for which the work done depends on path taken. An example is the friction force.

Mechanical Energy: ME = KE + PE
Conservation of ME principle: if only conservative forces do work, the ME of a system is constant in any process.

If no nonconservative forces are present: KE + PE = KEf + PEf
If nonconservative forces are present: KE + PE = KE + PE + W

Power(P): rate at which work is done
Watt(W): 1 joule of energy per second

P = delta E / delta t
P = W / delta t

Linear momentum
Momentum is conserved when no external forces act on a system
Describes the amount mass in motion
Forces cause a change in momentum, but momentum does not cause a force.

delta p = m * delta v
        = m(a * delta t)
        = Fnet * delta t

Impulse: delta p = Fnet * delta t

Momentum, energy, and angular momentum are conserved
*Conservation of momentum applies only to an isolated system of objects
Conservation of momentum is a direct consequence of Newton's third law

Closed system: system that is not acted by a net external force. Also called an isolated system
Conservation of momentum: in a closed (isolated) system, momentum is constant
Elastic collision: Collision where both momentum and KE are conserved. No change in KE
Inelastic collision: conserves momentum but not KE
Totally inelastic: collision where the objects stick together and have the same final velocity
Explosion: reverese inelastic collision where momentum is conserved and KE increases

We know a collision is elastic if KE is conserved and momentum is conserved

Center of mass = mass times its position, divided by total mass

Average angular acceleration (a): measure of how angular velocity changes over time
Tangential acceleration (at):  linear acceleration of a rotating object that is perpendicular to its radial acceleration

a = delta w / delta t
at = a * r

tangential acceleration changes with radius

Torque: t = rF * sin0

Rotational Inertia (I): resistance to change in rotational velocity (moment of inertia)
a = T / I

Second Law: Tnet = I * a

L = Iw
L = mvr
Angular momentum: delta L = T * delta t

Ug = - Gm1m2 / r
