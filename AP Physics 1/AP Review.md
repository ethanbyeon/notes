Velocity = Distance / Time
Distance = final - initial
Average Velocity = abs(final - initial) / t
Average Speed = abs(final - initial) / t

Instantneous Velocity = the slope at the exact position

Finding Displacement From Velocity Graphs
Find the area under the velocity vs. time graph

Acceleration and Velocity Graphs
Slope = linear + negative -> a = constant + negative

Kinematic Equations
v = vi + at
v^2 = vi^2 + 2a(delta x)
delta x = (v + vi / 2) t
delta x = vit + 1/2 at^2
