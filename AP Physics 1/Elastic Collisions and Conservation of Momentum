What is Principle of Conservation of Momentum?
In Physics, conservation refers to something which doesn't change.
  Same value both before and after an event.
  
In mechanics, there are three fundamental quantities which are conserved. These are momentum, energy, and angular momentum.
*Conservation of momentum applies only to an isolated system of objects (objects that are not acted on by force external to the system)

Principle of Conservation of Momentum:
P0 + P20 + ... = Pf + P2f + ...

Why is Momentum Conserved?
Conservation of momentum is a direct consequence of Newton's third law.
F(AB) = - F(BA) --> Equal force in the opposite direction (A due to B = B due to A)
t(AB) = t(BA)
F(AB) * t(AB) = - F(BA) * t(BA) --> Consequently, the impulse experienced by objects A and B must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

m(A) * delta V(A) = - m(B) * delta V(B)
m(A) * delta V(A) + m(B) * delta V(B) = 0

*Momentum is a vector quantity: use vector addition when summing tgether the momenta of the multiple bodies that make up a system.
*Conservation of momentum is only applied when external impulse is zero.
  Consider the points before collision and after collision so that the time interval is so small that gravity can't apply much impulse at all.
  
Ellastic Collision Review
Conservation of Momentum: In a closed sytem momentum is constant
Elastic collision: Collision where both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.
                   There is no change in kinetic energy in the system as a result of the collision.
                   
If we imagine ourselves sitting on object 1 moving at velocity V1, object 2 will look like it is moving at speed V1 - V2.
The difference in the velocities of the two objects tells us how fast object 1 is moving relative to object 2. 
That is called relative velocity.
