## **Key Terms**

| Term | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| Oscillatory Motion | Repeated back and forth movement about an equilibrium position |
| Restoring Force | A force acting opposite to displacement to bring the system back to equilibrium (or equilibrium position). The force magnitude depends only on displacement. |
| Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) | Oscillatory motion where the restoring force is the net force acting on the system.
| Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) | An object is a SHO when the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement. |
| Simple Pendulum | A mass suspended from a spring that can oscillate when displaced from its rest position. |

**Net force on the system = restoring force**  
**Equilibrium Position = Rest Position**  
**For a spring-mass system, the spring force is responsible for oscillation.**

## **Equations**

| Equation | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| ∣Fs​∣ = k∣x∣ | The magnitude of the spring force is directly proportional to the spring constant and the magnitude of displacement. |
| x(t) = A cos(2πft) | Displacement as a function of time is proportional to amplitude and the cosine of 2π multiplied by the frequency and time. |
| T p = 2π sqrt(l/g) | The pendulum's period is proportional to the square root of the pendulum's length and inversely proportional to the square root of g. |
| Us = 1/2 * kx^2 | Elastic potential energy |
| Δ Ug ​= mg Δy | Change in gravitational potential energy |
| K = 1/2 * mv^2 | Translational kinetic energy |

## Force, displacement, velocity, and acceleration for an oscillator

### **Hooke's Law**
Fs = -k x  

When x is **negative**, spring force is **positive**.  
When x is **positive**, spring force is **negative**.


Remember to apply *Newton's Second Law*  

**The restoring force is proportional to displacement from equilibrium.**  

For that reason, both the magnitude of the **restoring force** and the **acceleration** is the greatest at the maximum points of displacement.

When an object is at the equilibrium position, the net force on the object is zero and the magnitude of acceleration is zero.
The object has the greatest magnitude of acceleration when it has the greatest points of displacement.

## Analyzing Graphs: Period and Frequency

| Term | Meaning | 
| ---- | ------- |
| Amplitude (A) | The maximum magnitude of displacement from the equilibrium position.<br>**i.e.** "Peak to Peak,"  "Valley to Valley," "Crest to Crest" |
| Period (T) | The time required for an entire cycle (the time required for the entire system to "reset" at the equilibrium position). |
| Frequency (f) | The number of cycles per unit of time. |

f = 1 / T

Frequency (f) and period (t) are **independent** of amplitude (A).  
We can find the period by take two points on a graph (consecutive maximum or minimum points of displacement) and calculating the time between them.

## **Period Dependence for Mass on Spring**
Ts = 2π * sqrt ( m / k )
  
If the masses and springs are the same:  
Both vertical and horizontal spring-mass systems without friction oscillate identically.
    
## Misconceptions:

Increasing amplitude will **not** have an effect on the period of the oscillation.
Increasing amplitude means the mass travels more distance for once cycle.
Increasing amplitude **increases** the restoring force which proportionally **increases** the acceleration of the mass. The increase in acceleration causes the mass to movee through a greater distance in the same amount of time.

## **Simple Pendulums**

*Newton's Second Law* allows us to write an equation for the forces on the pendulum. THe x-component of the weight is the only force responsible for the oscillating motion of the pendulum.  

The restoring force on the pendulum:  
F = -mg sin θ  

For angles under 15°, we can approximate sin θ as θ which simplies the restoring force to:  
F ≈ −mg θ

 **Increasing the amplitude** (means larger distance to travel):      
 -->  The restoring force **increases**, which proportionally **increases** the acceleration. Thus, the mass can travel a greater distance at a greater speed. These attributes cancel each other, so amplitude has **no effect** on period. The pendulum’s inertia resists the change in direction, but it’s also the source of the restoring force. As a result, the mass cancels out as well. 

**Increasing** the length of the string --> increases moment of inertia --> increases period  
**Decreasing** the length of the string --> decreases period  

**Increasing** the gravitational acceleration --> increases force on the system --> greater speed --> decreases period
**Decreasing** the gravitational acceleration --> increases period
