# Simple Harmonic Motion

*Simple Harmonic Oscillator*: An object is a SHO when the restoring force is directly proportional to displacement.

**Net force on the system = restoring force**
                            
Restoring Force: 
  A force acting oppposite to displacement to bring the system or the object back to the equilibrium position (in its rest position).
Examples: A spring attatched to a mass or a pendulum

*Hooke's Law*: Fs = -kx

  The force, the force of the spring, is proportional to the amount that the spring is stretched (displacement).
  
  When x is **negative**, spring force is **positive**.
  When x is **positive**, spring force is **negative**.
  
  Using Newton's Second Law:
  
  When object is at the equilibrium position, the net force on the object is zero and the magnitude of acceleration is zero.
  The object has the greatest magnitude of acceleration when it has the greatest displacement.

*Amplitude* (A): The maximum "magnitude" of displacement from the equilibrium position.

*Period* (T) :The time required for an entire cycle (The time required for the entire system to reset at the equilibrium position).
i.e. "Peak to Peak,"  "Valley to Valley," "Crest to Crest"

x(t) = A * cos(w * t)

## Period Dependence for Mass on Spring

Ts = 2pi * sqrt(m / k)  Period of the spring-mass system is proportional to...
  
  If masses and springs are the same:
    Both vertical and horizontal spring-mass systems without friction oscillate identically
    
Misconceptions:
Increasing amplitude will not have an effect on the period of the oscillation.
Increasinng amplitude means the mass travels more distance for once cycle.
Increasing amplitude increases the restoring force --> proportionally increases the acceleration of the mass
--> mass movese through a greater distance in the same amount of time

## Pendulums

*Simple Pendulum*: A mass suspended form a string that can oscillate when displaced form its rest position.
T = 2pi * sqrt(l / g) Period of the pendulum is proportional to...

Increasing the length of the string -> increases moement of inertia -> increases period
Increasing the gravitational acceleration -> increases force on the system -> greater speed -> decreases period

## Energy of Simple Harmonic Oscillator Review

Elastic Potential Energy:                 Us = 1/2 * kx^2
Change in Gravitational Potential Energy: delta Ug = mg * delta y
Translational Kinetic Energy:             K = 1/2 * mv^2
Us, max = when K = 0 (endpoints of oscillation, v = 0)
K max = when Us = 0 (system moving through the equilibrium position, x = 0)
E tot = constant -> E tot = K max = Us, max
