# Simple Harmonic Motion
*Comprehending simple harmonic motion through a spring-mass and pendulum system.*
| Term | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| Oscillatory Motion | Repeated back and forth movement about an equilibrium position |
| Restoring Force | A force acting opposite to displacement to bring the system back to equilibrium (or equilibrium position). The force magnitude depends only on displacement. |
| Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) | Oscillatory motion where the restoring force is the net force acting on the system.
| Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) | An object is a SHO when the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement. |

**Net force on the system = restoring force**  
**Equilibrium Position = Rest Position**  
**For a spring-mass system, the spring force is responsible for oscillation.**

## **Equations**

| Equation | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| ∣Fs​∣ = k∣x∣ | The magnitude of the spring force is directly proportional to the spring constant and the magnitude of displacement. |
| x(t) = A cos(2πft) | Displacement as a function of time is proportional to amplitude and the cosine of 2π multiplied by the frequency and time. |

## **Hooke's Law**

| Term | Meaning | 
| ---- | ------- |
| Amplitude (A) | The maximum magnitude of displacement from the equilibrium position.<br>**i.e.** "Peak to Peak,"  "Valley to Valley," "Crest to Crest" |
| Period (T) | The time required for an entire cycle (the time required for the entire system to "reset" at the equilibrium position). |

Fs = -k x  

When x is **negative**, spring force is **positive**.  
When x is **positive**, spring force is **negative**.

**The restoring force is proportional to displacement from equilibrium.**  

For that reason, both the magnitude of the **restoring force** and the **acceleration** is the greatest at the maximum points of displacement.

*Using Newton's Second Law*  

When an object is at the equilibrium position, the net force on the object is zero and the magnitude of acceleration is zero.
The object has the greatest magnitude of acceleration when it has the greatest displacement.

## **Period Dependence for Mass on Spring**
Ts = 2π * sqrt ( m / k )
  
If the masses and springs are the same:  
Both vertical and horizontal spring-mass systems without friction oscillate identically.
    
## Misconceptions:

Increasing amplitude will not have an effect on the period of the oscillation.
Increasing amplitude means the mass travels more distance for once cycle.
Increasing amplitude increases the restoring force --> proportionally increases the acceleration of the mass
--> mass movese through a greater distance in the same amount of time

## **Pendulums**

*Simple Pendulum*: A mass suspended form a string that can oscillate when displaced form its rest position.
T = 2pi * sqrt(l / g) Period of the pendulum is proportional to...

Increasing the length of the string -> increases moment of inertia -> increases period
Increasing the gravitational acceleration -> increases force on the system -> greater speed -> decreases period

## **Energy of Simple Harmonic Oscillator Review**

| Equation | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| Us = 1/2 * kx^2 | Elastic potential energy |
| Δ Ug ​= mg Δy | Change in gravitational potential energy |
| K = 1/2 * mv^2 | Translational kinetic energy |

Us, max = when K = 0 (endpoints of oscillation, v = 0)  
K max = when Us = 0 (system moving through the equilibrium position, x = 0)  
E tot = constant -> E tot = K max = Us, max
