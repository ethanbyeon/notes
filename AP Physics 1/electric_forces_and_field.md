# Electric Forces and Fields 

## **Electric  Charge** 

Basic components of atoms: protons, neutrons, and electrons  
Protons and neutrons form the nucleus (referred to collectively as nucleons)  
Electromagnetic force holds the atom together  
Protons and electrons are intrinsically charge  
Charge is conserved  
Net charge cannot be created or destroyed  

Charge is quantized: q = n (+-e)  
e = 1.6 * 10^-19 C = elementary charge (basic unit of electric charge)  

## **Coulomb's Law** 

The electric force between two charged particles.  

### **Fe = k (q1 * q2) / r^2**  

**Coulomb's constant**: k = 9 * 10^9 N * m^2/C^2  
**Permittivity of free space**: k = 1 / 4 * pi *e (e = 8.85 * 10^-12 C^2/(N * m^2))  

Negative Fe = **attraction** | Positive Fe = **repulsion**  

## **The Electric Field** 
Gravitational field: Any mass placed in this field experiences a gravitational force due to this field 

*The interaction*: The presence of a charge creates an electric field in the space that surrounds it 

### **E = F (on q) / q**  

Consider a point charge Q in a fixed position (positive).  
Imagine moving a tiny positive testt charge q around to various locations near Q.  
We can measure the force that the test charge experiences at each location (F (on q)).  
--> resulting vector = electric field vector, E, at that location  

*The ratio*: intrinsic strength of the field due to the source charge  
The electric field vectors **farther** from the source charge are **shorter**  

**Expression for the strength of the electric field created by a point-charge source:**  
### **E = k (Q / r^2)**  

*Density of field lines:* Where the field lines are **denser**, the field is **stronger**
