# Waves 

Transverse Waves: Oscillations perpendicular to wave motion  

Longitudinal Wave: Oscillations parallel to wave motion (Oscillating Pressure Wave, Sounds waves)  

Speed of Sound in Air:  
V air = 323 m/s @ 20 C 

Speed of Sound in Solids:  
V = sqrt(B / P)  
Increase elastic modulis, speed of sound increases  
Increase density, speed of sound decreases  

Velocity of standing wave on string:  
V = sqrt(T / density)  

Subsonic < 343
Supersonic > 343  
20 Hz to 20 kHz  
Infrasonic < 20 Hz  
Ultrasonic > 20 kHz  

## Equations  
Length of the string:  
L = (n * lambda) / 2  

Wave length of any standing wave:  
lambda = 2L / n  
lambda n = lambda 1 / n  

Wave Speed:  
v = sqrt(T / m/L)

Find frequency of any standing wave:  
fn = n * f1  
fn = v * n/2L  

Intensity: power / area = p / 4 pi r^2 (W / m^2) 


f1 = 100 Hz 1st Harmonic  
f2 = 200 Hz 2nd Harmonic 1st Overtone  

Anything beyond 2-3 = overtones  
As # of standing waves increases, frequency increases and wave length decreases  

Nodes: Amplitude = 0   
Destructive interference occurs (diff = +- 0.5)  

Antinode: Maximum amplitude   
Constructive interference occurs (diff = +- 1)  

Beat frequency:  
fb = abs(f2 - f1)  

Doppler Effect:  
Source moves toward observer = Frequency increases  
Source moves away from observer = Frequency decreases  

fo = fs[(v +- vo) / (v -+ vs)]
