Introduction to Momentum
P = m * v
F = m * a
  = m * delta v / delta t
  = delta (mv) / delta t
  = delta p / delta t

F * delta t = impulse (J)

Linear Momentum Review
P = Product of an object's mass and velocity.
    Momentum is conserved when no external forces act on a system (kg * m / s)

P = mv
delta p = F(net) * delta t

How P and F(net) are Related
delta p = m * delta v
        = m(a * delta t)
        = F(net) * delta t
delta p = F(net) * delta t
F(net) = delta p / delta t

Key Concepts
Momentum: Vector quantity that describes amount of mass in motion.
Kinetic: Measure of an object's energy from motion.

Forces cause a change in momentum, but momentum does not cause a change in force.

Impulse Review
F * delta t = Product of average force exerted on an object and the time interval during which the force is being applied.
              Equal to change in momentum (N * s) or (kg * m / s)
              
delta p = F(net) * delta t

How Force Changes Momentum
F * delta t = delta p
F = delta p / delta t --> Rate at which momentum changes

Key Concept
Impulse is a vector: negative impulse means net force is in the negative direction.
