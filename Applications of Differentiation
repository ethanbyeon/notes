Application of Differentiation

Mean Value Theorem (EVT)
f is continuous over [a,b] and differentiable over (a,b)
There exists some c E (a,b) where:                        (E: logical symbol: "in the interval")
delta y / delta x = (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a) = derivative of c
  
Establishing Differentiability for MVT
MVT and its Conditions
  Guarantees for a function f that's differentiable over an interval from a to b,
  that there exists a number c on that interval such that derivative of c is equal
  to the functions average rate of change over the interval.
    
  derivative of c = (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a)
    
Graphically, the arc between 2 end points has a point which tangent to the arc is parallel to the secant through its endpoints.
*For MVT to apply, the function must be differentiable over the relevant interval, and continuous at the interval's edges.
  
  IVT guarantees the point where the function has certain value between 2 given values
  EVT guarantees the point where the function obtains a maximum or minimum value
  *MVT guarantees the point where the *derivative* has a certain value
  
MVT connects the average rate of change of a function to its derivative

Justification With MVT: Equation
g(x) = 1 /x; derivative of x = 1 / 2; -1 < x < 2
  No, not continuous or differentiable over interval.
  
derivative of c = -1 / 2; 1 < c < 2
  g(x) is a rational function --> continuous and differentiable at every point in its domain. [1,2] is in domain:
  (g(2) - g(1)) / (2 - 1) = ((1 / 2) - 1 )/ 1 = -1 /2
  Therefore, by the MVT, there must be a point c where 1 < c < 2 and derivative of c = -1 / 2
  
Polynomials
f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8; [2,5] find c E (2,5) such that derivative of c = (f(5) - f(2)) / (5 - 2) = 3 / 3 = 1

f(5) = 25 - 30 + 8 = 3
f(2) = 4 - 12 + 8 = 0

derivative of f = 2x - 6 = 1
                  2x = 7
                  x = 7 / 2
                  
Square Root
f(x) = sqrt(4x - 3); 1 <= x <= 3

f(x) = (4x - 3)^(1 / 2)
derivative of x = (1 / 2)(4x - 3)^(-1 / 2)(4)
derivative of x = 2 / (sqrt(4x - 3))

derivative of c = (f(3) - f(1)) / (3 - 1)
2 / sqrt(4c - 3) = (3 - 1) / (3 - 1) = 2 / 2 = 1
2 / sqrt(4c - 3) 1
(2 = sqrt(4c - 3))^2
4 = 4c - 3
4c = 7
c = 7 / 4

Extreme Value Theorem (EVT)
f continuous [a,b] 
∃ (logical symbol: "there exits") absolute maximum value of f over the interval:
∃ c, d E[a,b]: f(c) <= f(x) <= f(d) or min <= f(x) <= max for all x E[a,b]

Critical Points
If there is a minimum or maximum at x = a where they are not at endpoints and 
if derivative of a = 0 or derivative of a is undefined --> critcal points

Finding Critical Points
Ex: f(x) = xe^(-2x^2)
c is a critcal number of f : 1 / 2, - 1 / 2
  if and only if: derivative of c = 0 or derivative of c is undefined
  
derivative of x = d/dx [x]e^(-2x^2) + d/dx [e^(-2x^2)]x
                = e^(-2x^2) + e^(-2x^2)(-4x)x
                = e^(-2x^2) (1-4x^2)
                
                1 - 4x^2 = 0
                1 = 4x^2
                1 / 4 = x^2
                x = +/- 1 / 2
                
                derivative of f at (+/- 1 / 2) = 0
