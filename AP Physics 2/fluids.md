# Fluids

*There are four states of matter that are observable in everyday life: Solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.*

---

### Solid :ice_cube:
* Has definite shape and volume.  
* Atoms are held together by electrical forces. 
* Atoms vibrate about specifc positions with respect to one another.  
* Solids tends to return to its orginal shape and size (elastisity).  


**Crystalline Solid:** Ordered structure  
**Amorphous Solid:** Atoms are arranged almost randomly  

### Liquid :droplet:
* Has definite volume but no definite shape.  
* Exists at a higher temperature than the solid state.  

Both solids and liquids have the property where strong repulsive atomic forces act internally to resist compression.  

### Gas :cloud:
* Has neither definite volume nore definite shape.  
* Molecules are in constant random motion and exert only weak forces on each other.  
* Can be easily compressed.

### Plasma :zap:
Highly ionized (electrons freed from the surrounding nucleus when heated to high temperature) state of matter containing equal amounts of positive and negative charges.
* Long-range electric and magnetic forces interact with each other.  
* Found in stars and in accretion disks around black holes.

### The Deformations of Solids  
*A sufficiently large force will permanently deform or break an object.*  

**Elastic behavior:** When external forces are removed, the object tends to return to its original shape and size.  

**Stress:** force per unit area causing a deformation  
**Strain:** measure of the amount of the deformation  

Stress is proportional to strain (Proportionality constant: elastic modulus).  
*Constant can be taken as the stiffness of a material.*  

*stress = elastic modulus * strain*  

**Stress causes strain.**

#### Young's Modulus: Elasticity in Length  
**Tensile Stress:** The ratio of the magnitude of the external force ![F](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F) to the cross sectional area ![A](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A).  

**Pascal (Pa):**  
![Young's Modulus](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%20Pa%20%3D%201%20N/m%5E2)  

**Tensile Strain:** The ratio of the change in length ![Delta L](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20L) to the original length ![L](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L) (Dimensionless quantity)  

![Young's Modulus](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7BF%7D%7BA%7D%3DY%28%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20L%7D%7BL%7D%29)

![Y](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Y) is called **Young's modulus**.  
This quanitity characterizes a rod or wire stressed under either tension or compression (![Y](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Y) is in pascals).  

**Elastic limit:** Point where the stress-strain curve departs from a straight line.  
**Ultimate strength:** The greatest stress the substance can withstand without breaking.  
**Breaking point:** Point beyond ultimate strength for brittle materials.

#### Shear Modulus: Elasticity of Shape  
**Shear Stress:** A type of deformation that occurs when an object is subjected to a force parallel to one of its faces while the opposite face is held fixed by a second force. Applied force is parallel to the cross-sectional area while tensile stress is the force perpendicular to the cross-sectional area.

#### Bulk Modulus: Volume Elasticity  
Characterizes the response of a substance to uniform squeezing.  

**Volume strain:**

*An increase in pressure causes a decrease in volume and vice versa.*
