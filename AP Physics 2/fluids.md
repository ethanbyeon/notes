States of Matter
Solid, liquid, gas, and plasma

Solid: 
Has definite shape and volume.
Atoms are held together by electrical forces and vibrate about specifc positions with respect to one another. Solids tends to return to its orginal shape and size. -> elasticity

Crystalline Solid: Ordered structure
Amorphous Solid: Atoms are arranged almost randomly

Liquid: 
Has definite volume but no definite shape.
Exists at a higher temperature than the solid state.

Solid and Liquid:
Both have the propoerty where strong repulsive atomic forces act internally to resist compression.

Gas: 
Has neither definite volume nore definite shape.
Molecules are in constant random motion and exert only weak forces on each other.
Can be easily compressed.

Plasma: Highly ionized (electrons freed from the surrounding nucleus when heated to high temperature) state of matter containing equal amounts of positive and negative charges
Long-range electric and magnetic forces interact with each other.
Found in stars and in accretion disks around black holes.

The Deformations of Solids
A sufficiently large force will permanently deform or break an object.
Elastic behavior: When external forces are removed, the object tends to return to its original shape and size.

Stress: force per unit area cuasing a deformation
Strain: measure of the amount of the deformation

Stress is proportional to strain (Proportionality constant: elastic modulus).
stress = elastic modulus * strain
Constant can be taken as the stiffness of a material.

Young's Modulus: Elasticity in Length
Tensile Stress: The ratio of the magnitude of the external force F to the cross sectional area A.
Pascal (PA): 1 Pa = 1 N / m^2
Tensile Strain: The ratio of the change in length delta L to the original length L (Dimensionless quantity)
F / A  = Y (delta L / L)
Y is called Young's modulus.
This quanitity characterizes a rod or wire stressed under either tension or compression (Y is in pascalas).

Elastic limit: Point where the stress-strain curve departs from a straight line. 
Ultimate strength: teh greates stress the substance can withstand without breaking
Breaking point: Point beyond ultimate strength for brittle materials

Shear Modulus: Elasticity of Shape
Shear Stress: A type of deformation that occurs when an object is subjected to a force parallel to one of its faces while the opposite face is held fixed by a second force.
Applied force is parallel to the cross-sectional area while tensile stress is the force perpendicular to the cross-sectional area.
F / A = S (delta x / h)

Bulk Modulus: Volume Elasticity
Characterizes the response of a substance to uniform squeezing.
Volume strain: Delta P = -B (delta V /  V)
An increase in pressure causes a decrease in volume.
