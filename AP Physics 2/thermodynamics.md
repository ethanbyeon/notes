# Thermodynamics

### Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Ideal Gas Law
F = delta P / delta T 
P = F / A 
PV = k -> P1V1 = k = P2V2 

Increase in temperature -> Increase in energy 
**Temperature:** The measure of average kinteic energy per molecule in a substance. 
T = k KE(sys) / N -> (energy / molecule) 
KE(sys) = k * N * T 

PV = k * (KE(sys)) 
PV = k * (N * T) -> if N is constant 
PV / T = k 
P1V1 / T1 = P2V2 / T2 
* If temperature increases and volume is constant, pressure increases. 
* If temperature increases and volume increases, pressure is constant. 

PV = k * KE(sys) = k * N * T 
-> PV = n * R * T 
* n = mole = 6.023 * 10^23 
* R = 8.31 J / mol*k 
* T = Kelvin 

#### Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution 
* Area under curve = Total number of molecules 
* Colder: left, tall, narrow 
* Hotter: right, short, wider 
* Higer in region = more gas molecules moving with those speeds 


### Thermal Conduction and Heat Transfer
* Transfer of energy = Heat 
**Conduction:** The flow of internal energy from a region of higher temperature to one of lower temperature by the interaction of the adjacent particles in the intervening space. 
**Convection:** The transfer of internal energy into or out of an object by the physical movement of a surrounding fluid that transfers the internal energy along with its mass. 
**Thermal Radiation:** Acceleration of charged particles 

* Different material transfer heat at different rates 
* Metals are good at taking away heat as the molecules are packed densely together. 
* The more spaced the molecules are in a material, the more time it takes to transfer energy. 

### Rate of Thermal Conduction 
*The amount of heat transferred per unit time.* 
Q / t = ? 
* As area increases, the rate, Q / t, increases. 
* As area decreases, the rate, Q / t, decreases.
* If the thickness of the material increases, the rate, Q / t, decreases.
* If the thickness of the material decreases, the rate, Q / t, increases. 
* Ta > Tb: As (Ta - Tb) increases, the rate, Q / t increases 
Q / t = k * A(Ta - Tb) / d 
* k = material of the wall 

### Laws of Thermodynamics 
U = internal energy of a gas 
Q = energy a gas gains through thermal conduction (heat added to the gas)
W = work done on the gas
T = energy a gas has at a given moment (P * delta V)

**1st Law:** delta U = Q + W 
* Two ways to add internal energy to a gas 
* U is proportional to T: As U increases, T increases. As U decreases, T decreases.

**Isobaric:** Constant pressure 
* delta U = Q + (-P * delta V) 
**Isothermal:** Constant temperature 
* delta U = 0, delta T = 0, delta (PV) = 0 
* PV = nRT -> P = nRT / v (nRT is constant) 
**Isometric:** Constant volume 
* W = 0, delta U = Q 
**Adiabatic:** "No heat exchanged" 
* Q = 0, delta U = W 

Area under curve = work by gas 
= P * delta V = F / A * delta(hA) 
= FA/ A * delta h = F * delta h = work 

#### Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases 
PV = N * m * (Avg. V^2) = Nm / 3 * (Avg. Vtot ^2) 
-> 3/2 * PV = N[1/2 * m * (Avg. Vtot^2)] 
-> 3/2 * PV = [N * KE avg] = Utot
-> KE avg = 3/2 * nRT 
-> Utot = 3/2 PV 
= 3/2 nRT
