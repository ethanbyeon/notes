CHAPTER 2
1. Tangent and Velocity
2. Limit Laws
3. Squeeze Theorem: If f(x) <= g(x) <= h(x) when x is near a (except possibly a) and lim f(x) = lim h(x) = L, then lim g(x) = L

Product Rule
Quotient Rule
Chain Rule

1. Implicit Differentiation
2. Velocity: First Derivative, Acceleration: Second Derivative
  To Find Total Distance Traveled in a Given Time Interval:
    1. Find Critical Points Using First Derivative
    2. Break up the Function into smaller intervals and find the distance traveled in each interval
    3. Add the sum of each interval (|y - y2|)
 3. Related Rates
 4. Linear Approximation 

CHAPTER 4
1. Finding Local and Absolute Extreme Values of a Function
  Find Derivative of the Function
  Find the Critical Points of the Function
  Use critical points to determine the local and absolute extreme values by plugging them back into the original function
  
2. Evaluating Limits
  Use L'Hospital when needed to take the derivative of each function individually (derivative of numerator/denominator)
  NOTE: Limits that approach 0 doesn't approach exactly 0. You must convert to 0/0 or infinite/infinite then use L'Hospital's Rule
  
3. Sketching Graphs of a function
  1. Find Domain of the Function
  2. Find X and Y Intercepts
  3. Determine if Function is Even, Odd, or Neither
  4. Find end Limits
  5. Find Where Function is Increasing and Decreasing
  6. Use Second Derivative of Function to Determine the Concavity of the Function and Inflection Points
  
Additional Notes:

b ln(a) = ln(a^b)
ln(e^u) = u
e^ln(a) = a

CH. 3.
lim sin(c*theta) / c*teta = 1 and vice versa
lim cos(theta) - 1 / theta = 0
Circles: A = pi*r^2   c = 2*pi*r
Triangles: a^2 + b^2 = c^2   A = 1/2 bh
Cylinders: v = pi*r^2*h   SA = 2*pi*r*h + 2*pi*r^2
Sphere: v = 4/3*pi&r^3   SA = 4*pi*r^3
Right Circular Cone: v = (pi*r^2*h) / 3   SA = pi*r*sqrt(r^2+h^2) + pi*r^2
