MVT
1. Is the function differentiable or continuous
2. State the average rate of change over the interval

EVT
1. Continuous -> must have an absolute max or min over any closed interval
2. Find critical points
3. Make number line
4. Plug numbers to determine sign
5. Check the values at the critical and endpoints of the interval

Increase/Decrease
1. Find critical points
2. Make number line
3. Plug in numbers to determine the sign (+/-)
4. Observe the intervals of increase or decrease

Relative Minima & Maxima
1. Find critical points
2. Make number line
3. Plug in numbers to determine sign
4. If increasing -> decreasing = relative maxima
5. If decreasing -> increasing = relative minima

Concavity
1. Find critical points (second derivative)
2. Make number line
3. If positive -> concave up (U). If negative -> concave down

Second Derivative Test
1. If positive, the function has a relative minimum at that critical value
2. If negative, the function has a relative maximum at that critical value
3. If inconclusive, the function may be a point of inflection
